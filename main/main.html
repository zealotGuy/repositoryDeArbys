    <p>  I am kind of: Intelligent, dedicated, happy. </p>

    <p>I dont know what I want to be, but I want it to be related to code because I feel like if I practice and stay focused i can do stuff
        that i cant even dream of. Computer Science is fun and I understand the topics, but my only problem is with documentation as I always
        make some mistake whatsoever. Back to jobs, I feel like doing a job related to game design or website design as I have recently taken
        an interest in HTML and CSS, so that is something else that I would wnat to do when I grow up.

    <p>As of clubs, I am in a bunch of clubs, however I am an officer for 2 clubs: Publicity Director in EHS Scioly and the Secretary of EHS
        NCA PDA. Most of the clubs I am in are just starting, with only scioly being the only active club.
    </p><br>
    <p>As of school in general, I am excited for this semester and I hope that I can be more successful than I was last time. I hope 
       that I can improve on the bad habits that I displayed the first semester and try to pay attention more as that is my main weakness.
       I am in the newly formed archeology club, and I also do want to join clubs like the AI club and the Table Tennis Club.
    </p><br>
    <p>Regarding colleges, I want to go to a UC, like UCSD as my friend went there as well and he is a good role model. I strive to go 
       to a good UC, and colleges out of California, like Georgia Tech. I hope that with good friends and role models I can do just as 
       much, maybe even more if I try to accomplish tasks that I couldn't dream of.
    </p><br>
    <p>Fun Fact about me: Almost all of my friends call me arbys(ask arshan for more details)</p><br>

    <p>Thank you for looking at my about me page! Currently, I am not employing a lot of HTML and CSS, but in the future
        when I make another webpage, I hope that I can make it a lot better to show my impprovement and dedication to this project!
